By Prolocation: In engineblock root dir run: ./bin/composer.phar install, this requires the user executing it having write permissions in the vendor dir
By Prolocation: Replace all logging config (lines starting with logs.), with:

ACC:
; Mail Logging
logs.mail.writerParams.from.email = "no-reply@surfnet.nl"
logs.mail.writerParams.from.name  = "SURFconext EngineBlock Acceptatie"
logs.mail.writerParams.to.0.name  = "COIN Logs"
logs.mail.writerParams.to.0.email = "coin-logs@list.surfnet.nl"
; Configuration values you want to filter out of error mails
logs.mail.writerParams.filterValues[] = "encryption.key.private"
logs.mail.writerParams.filterValues[] = "ldap.password"
logs.mail.writerParams.filterValues[] = "serviceRegistry.user_secret"
logs.mail.writerParams.filterValues[] = "database.master1.password"
logs.mail.writerParams.filterValues[] = "grouper.password"
logs.mail.writerParams.filterValues[] = "hz.auth.consumerSecret"

By TPMs: Possibly configure NameIDFormat for Idp's in Service Registry if not set since it is no longer set to a default value of transient
By TPMs: Possbily correct NameIDFormat unspecified from 2.0 to 1.1. NameIDFormat unspecified does no longer exist in SAML 2.0
    But was used mistakenly used in Engineblock and as such configured in service registry. Both Engineblock and service registry
    now also support the correct version (1.1) so this can be used if required. In time this configuration should be
    corrected everywhere.
